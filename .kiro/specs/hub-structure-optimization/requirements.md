# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current hub directory structure in the ng-alain project needs optimization to align with Angular v20 best practices, improve scalability, maintainability, and support future feature expansion. The hub currently contains mixed concerns including contract management, generic CRUD operations, settings, and utility components that need better organization and separation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear feature-based directory structure, so that I can easily locate and maintain related components, services, and models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the hub directory THEN the system SHALL use feature-based organization over file-type organization
2. WHEN creating new features THEN each feature SHALL have its own dedicated directory with clear boundaries
3. WHEN accessing feature components THEN the system SHALL provide barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports
4. WHEN examining the structure THEN related files SHALL be co-located within their feature directories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper separation of concerns between business logic and generic utilities, so that I can reuse components across different features without coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing generic functionality THEN the system SHALL separate it from business-specific logic
2. WHEN creating reusable components THEN they SHALL be placed in a shared directory structure
3. WHEN business logic depends on generic services THEN the coupling SHALL be through well-defined interfaces
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN generic components SHALL not contain business-specific code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Angular v20 standalone components and modern patterns, so that I can leverage the latest framework capabilities and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN they SHALL use standalone component architecture
2. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL use Angular v20 signals where appropriate
3. WHEN handling change detection THEN components SHALL use OnPush strategy
4. WHEN organizing imports THEN the system SHALL use modern ES module patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear module boundaries and lazy loading support, so that I can optimize application performance and maintain clean architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading features THEN they SHALL support lazy loading through route-based code splitting
2. WHEN defining feature modules THEN they SHALL have clear public APIs through barrel exports
3. WHEN accessing cross-feature functionality THEN it SHALL go through well-defined interfaces
4. WHEN bundling the application THEN features SHALL be independently loadable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent naming conventions and file organization, so that I can navigate the codebase efficiently and maintain consistency across the team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN naming directories THEN they SHALL use kebab-case format
2. WHEN naming components THEN they SHALL follow Angular naming conventions with feature prefixes
3. WHEN organizing files THEN they SHALL follow a consistent pattern within each feature
4. WHEN creating new features THEN they SHALL adhere to the established structure template

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper abstraction layers for data access and business logic, so that I can maintain clean architecture and testability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use repository pattern or service abstraction
2. WHEN implementing business logic THEN it SHALL be separated from UI concerns
3. WHEN testing components THEN business logic SHALL be easily mockable
4. WHEN changing data sources THEN it SHALL not require changes to business logic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want support for future multi-payment and dynamic approval workflow features, so that the structure can accommodate planned enhancements without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding payment features THEN the structure SHALL accommodate nested payment components
2. WHEN implementing workflow features THEN they SHALL integrate cleanly with existing contract structure
3. WHEN extending contract functionality THEN it SHALL not break existing features
4. WHEN adding new business domains THEN the structure SHALL support them without architectural changes
