# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Contract Payments feature enables contracts to support multiple payment requests with dynamic approval workflows. This feature extends the existing single-layer contract structure to support nested payment sub-tables with inline editing, dynamic loading, and workflow-based status transitions. Each payment request can be bound to a dynamic approval workflow with proper state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a contract manager, I want to expand contracts to show multiple payment requests in a sub-table, so that I can manage all payments related to a specific contract in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a contract row THEN the system SHALL display an expandable sub-table showing all payment requests for that contract
2. WHEN the sub-table loads THEN the system SHALL dynamically load payment data using the contract ID
3. WHEN displaying payment requests THEN the system SHALL show payment amount, status, workflow information, and creation date
4. WHEN no payment requests exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with an option to create the first payment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a contract manager, I want to create and edit payment requests inline within the sub-table, so that I can efficiently manage payment information without navigating to separate forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Add Payment" THEN the system SHALL create a new editable row in the sub-table
2. WHEN editing a payment request THEN the system SHALL provide inline form fields for amount, remarks, and attachments
3. WHEN a user saves a payment request THEN the system SHALL validate the data and persist changes to the database
4. WHEN a user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL revert any unsaved changes and return to display mode
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages inline without losing user input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a contract manager, I want payment requests to automatically use the appropriate workflow template based on the client, so that approval processes are consistent and properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new payment request THEN the system SHALL automatically select the workflow template based on the contract's client
2. WHEN a workflow is assigned THEN the system SHALL initialize the payment status to 'draft'
3. WHEN a payment enters a workflow THEN the system SHALL create workflow steps based on the template definition
4. WHEN workflow steps are created THEN the system SHALL set initial step statuses to 'pending' for the first step and 'waiting' for subsequent steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a contract manager, I want to track payment request status transitions through the approval workflow, so that I can monitor progress and ensure proper approvals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment status changes THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding workflow step status
2. WHEN a workflow step is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically advance to the next step if conditions are met
3. WHEN all workflow steps are completed THEN the system SHALL update the payment status to 'approved'
4. WHEN a workflow step is rejected THEN the system SHALL update the payment status to 'rejected' and halt progression
5. WHEN status transitions occur THEN the system SHALL record timestamps and user information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage workflow templates through a settings interface, so that I can configure approval processes for different clients and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing workflow settings THEN the system SHALL display a list of existing workflow templates
2. WHEN creating a workflow template THEN the system SHALL allow defining multiple steps with approver assignments
3. WHEN editing a workflow template THEN the system SHALL support reordering steps and modifying step conditions
4. WHEN deleting a workflow template THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if the template is in use by active payments
5. WHEN saving workflow changes THEN the system SHALL validate template structure and step dependencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a contract manager, I want to attach documents to payment requests, so that I can provide supporting documentation for approval processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a payment request THEN the system SHALL provide an attachment upload interface
2. WHEN uploading attachments THEN the system SHALL validate file types and size limits
3. WHEN attachments are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store files securely and associate them with the payment request
4. WHEN viewing payment requests THEN the system SHALL display attachment lists with download capabilities
5. WHEN deleting payment requests THEN the system SHALL also remove associated attachment files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a contract manager, I want the payment sub-table to integrate seamlessly with the existing contract list interface, so that the user experience remains consistent and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contract list loads THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality while supporting payment expansion
2. WHEN expanding payment sub-tables THEN the system SHALL use consistent UI patterns with the parent contract list
3. WHEN performing payment operations THEN the system SHALL follow the same OnPush strategy and type safety as the parent component
4. WHEN errors occur in payment operations THEN the system SHALL display error messages using the same notification system as the contract list
5. WHEN payment data changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI reactively without requiring full page refresh
