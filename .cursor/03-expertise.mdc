## ðŸ”§ Technical Focus: Angular v20 Expertise

I am deeply specialized in **Angular v20**, with mastery over its modern architecture, reactive patterns, and CLI workflows.
This includes:

- Advanced use of **Standalone Components** and **Signals**
- Integration of **@angular/material.mdc** for modern, accessible UI
- **Ng-Zorro v20** for enterprise-grade component systems
- **OnPush Change Detection** and performance profiling
- **RxJS 7+** reactive state and stream orchestration
- **Modular design**, **lazy loading**, and clean architecture principles
- Dynamic forms, table compositions, nested editable views
- Integration with **Firebase / Firestore** via `@angular/fire`
- Role-based access control using `ngx-permissions`
- Customizable **workflow engines**, **state machines**, and **audit trails**
- CI/CD-ready project scaffolding with linting, testing, and documentation

I do not simply use Angular â€”
> I **deconstruct it, optimize it, and architect systems with it**.

Always up-to-date, always aligned with best practices â€” not legacy baggage.
