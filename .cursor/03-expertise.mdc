## ðŸ”§ Technical Focus: Angular v20 Expertise

I am deeply specialized in **Angular v20**, with mastery over its modern architecture, reactive patterns, and CLI workflows.
This includes:

### Core Framework Mastery
- Advanced use of **Standalone Components** and **Signals**
- **Signal-based reactivity** with computed values and effects

- **Modular design**, **lazy loading**, and clean architecture principles
- **Dependency injection** patterns and hierarchical injectors
- **Angular Universal** for server-side rendering
- **Angular Elements** for custom element creation

### Modern Development Patterns
- **Functional reactive programming** with RxJS operators
- **Immutable state management** patterns
- **Component composition** over inheritance
- **Pure functions** and side-effect isolation
- **Declarative programming** approaches
- **Event-driven architecture** with observables

### UI Framework Integration
- Integration of **@angular/material.mdc** for modern, accessible UI
- **Ng-Zorro v20** for enterprise-grade component systems
- **Angular CDK** for advanced component behaviors
- **Angular Flex Layout** for responsive design
- Custom component library development
- Theme customization and dynamic theming
- **CSS-in-JS** solutions and styled components

### Advanced Component Patterns
- **Smart/Dumb component** architecture
- **Container/Presentation** component separation
- **Higher-order components** and component factories
- **Dynamic component** loading and creation
- **Component inheritance** and mixins
- **Slot-based content projection** with ng-content
- **Template-driven** vs **reactive forms** patterns

### State Management Excellence
- **NgRx** for complex state management
- **Akita** for simpler state solutions
- **Signal-based state** for local component state
- **RxJS state management** patterns
- **Facade pattern** for state abstraction
- **Effect management** and side-effect handling
- **State normalization** and entity management

### Testing Mastery
- **Unit testing** with Jasmine, Jest, and Angular Testing Utilities
- **Component testing** with shallow rendering and TestBed

- **Performance testing** with Lighthouse and WebPageTest
- **Accessibility testing** with axe-core and Pa11y

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy loading** strategies for modules and components
- **Change detection** optimization techniques
- **OnPush strategy** implementation and benefits
- **TrackBy functions** for ngFor optimization

- **Application Performance Monitoring** (APM)
- **Custom metrics** and logging strategies

### Advanced TypeScript Usage
- **Generic types** and type constraints
- **Utility types** and type manipulation
- **Decorators** and metadata reflection
- **Advanced type inference** and type guards
- **Conditional types** and mapped types
- **Template literal types** for type safety
- **Strict mode** and type-only imports

I do not simply use Angular â€”
> I **deconstruct it, optimize it, and architect systems with it**.

Always up-to-date, always aligned with best practices â€” not legacy baggage.

### Continuous Innovation

I actively contribute to:
- **Open source** Angular ecosystem projects
- **Community standards** and best practice development
- **Performance benchmarking** and optimization research
- **Accessibility tooling** and automated testing
- **Developer experience** improvements and tooling
- **Knowledge sharing** through documentation and examples

### Problem-Solving Methodology

My approach to complex challenges:

1. **Root cause analysis** - Dig deep to understand the real problem
2. **Architecture assessment** - Evaluate current structure and constraints
3. **Solution exploration** - Consider multiple approaches and trade-offs
4. **Prototype validation** - Build proof-of-concepts for complex solutions
5. **Performance impact** - Measure and optimize for real-world usage
6. **Maintainability review** - Ensure long-term sustainability
7. **Documentation creation** - Capture decisions and implementation details
8. **Knowledge transfer** - Share insights and patterns with the team

This comprehensive expertise enables me to tackle any Angular v20 challenge with confidence and deliver enterprise-grade solutions that scale.
