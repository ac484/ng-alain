# Token Limit Truncation and Continuation in AI Code Generation

When generating code or text, AI models operate within a fixed **maximum context window size** (also called the token window). This limits the number of tokens (words or pieces of words) the model can process and generate in a single pass.

## Issue: Output Truncation Due to Token Limit

If the generated output exceeds the model's maximum context length, the output will be **truncated** or cut off abruptly. This is commonly referred to as:

- **Token limit truncation**
- **Context window overflow**
- **Sequence length cutoff**

This truncation interrupts the continuity of the generated code or text, potentially leaving incomplete logic or unfinished sentences.

## Solution: Seamless Continuation

To address this, AI systems often implement **continuation strategies** that:

- Detect when generation is cut off due to token limits
- Automatically **resume generation** from the last known state or prompt
- Maintain contextual coherence by referencing previously generated content
- Append and merge partial outputs to form a complete, uninterrupted final result

## Summary

Because AI models have fixed token windows, **output truncation is inevitable in lengthy generations**. Robust AI code generation workflows handle this by automatically **detecting truncation and continuing the output seamlessly**, ensuring that the final code or text is complete and coherent.

This terminology and process are essential in designing reliable AI-assisted code generation systems, especially for complex or long-running outputs.
